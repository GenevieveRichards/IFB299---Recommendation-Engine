The selected architecture pattern for the smart city project is the 3-tier architecture, i.e., the client-server architecture, due to the following reasons:
•	In this pattern, each layer can run on a different machine.
•	The three layers – presentation, logic and data are disconnected. Thus, changes made in any platform affects the layer running on that platform only. 
•	In addition, a 3-tier architecture is easier to maintain due to the separation of components.
•	Each component is reusable.
•	It supports division of work.
